                    <h4>
          A good friend of mine compared me to a puffer fish the other day. I thought it was a really random comparison and in the spirit of that I sort of just decided to create a puffer fish animation with CSS. I wanted to do something fun and I was inspired by a recent youtube video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZdj42liTtU">DevTips</a> that reminded me of how fun and useful CSS animations are.

        Ok so it really only was like a 8 month period and it's just the original design of my webpage. Still this design was one of the most unique and funky designs I have ever came up with. It had a circular navbar that would expand when hovered over. The colors were all flashy and bright, and the overall theme of the pages included rococo-style patterns and colorful abstract images with a dried acrylic texture. I really loved the design but it had alot of issues translating onto mobile devices and though I fixed alot of bugs the fact is that modern devices aren't suited for circular navbars yet. It is possible to create a great user interface with a circular navigation but would require a lot of planning and work. I also felt that other people didn't exactly apprectiate the artistic style as much as I did. Fearing this could impact the possibility of employment somewhere I decided to redesign my site into the lovely site you have been navigating through right now.
                      <br> I still love that original design and have added a page on here with some of my favorite characteristics so you can check them out yourself.

                <h4>I don't like to get very political but sometimes I just find it necessary. Planned Parenthood is a great community institution that has been around for centuries. To be honest all I know about safe sex I learned through programs provided by planned parenthood in middle school and high school. I'm a straight male and have used their services countless times, so when I see politians attacking it I just had to act. This page lets people e-mail members of congress that support defunding Planned Parenthood. While creating this page it turns out most of the loudest congress members don't even have direct e-mail addresses. I find it sad, that the leaders in washington who are supposed to represent the people make it difficult for the people to communicate with them. Still this page is useful in e-mailing some of the anti-Planned Parenthood Politicians, including Mitch McConnel, and also includes the phone numbers to those congress members without direct e-mails. If you feel passionate about this issue feel free to share this page with your friends! </h4>

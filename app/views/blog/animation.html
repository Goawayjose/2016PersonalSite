      <h1>The Future of Web Animation with Val Head</h1>
      <p>
      	Val Head released a book titled Designing Interface Animation where she attempts to “give folks a solid animation to build from.” In this interview with alistapart.com, she gives some of her opinions about the future of web Animation that I couldn’t agree more with. She recognizes that historically, on the web, there has been a disconnect between animation and standard practices.  But with CSS and Javascript becoming more powerful than ever animation’s can now become a standard part of the web experience. The issue is with the new technology designers are tasked with now creatively using animations in a way that will benefit the user experience. <br><br>
      	She uses a good example of typography for the web. How designers used to look down on the medium because of it’s limitations with fonts but after the web matured and custom fonts became available for developers the designs of the web drastically improved and now it is becoming it’s own thing. Same with animation people continue to use the same animation principles but the web is it’s own unique medium and though it makes references to the past it will naturally create it’s own principle’s of animation. She provides good examples of sites that are using animations in a really unique way. I especially like was this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/05/sports/olympics-gymnast-simone-biles.html?_r=0">New York Times article she used about Simone Biles.</a> One valuable thing that I got from Head’s interview is the idea of using the “same words you use to describe how you want your content to feel can be a basis of how you aim to make the animation feel as well.” The idea of consistency has to be true with animation but it’s difficult to think of that with still content. But if one were to think of the over all goals of the project and maintain those ideas with the design of the animations, these animations will flow a lot more naturally with the content.  </p>    <div id="back-Btn">
